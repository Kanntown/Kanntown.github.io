  	<h3>Background</h3>
  	<p>Kristi began shooting at the age of fifteen. Learning the old tried and true methods of black and white 35mm darkroom photography, Kristi spent countless hours holed up in the depths of her high school's darkroom. Originally, Kristi primarily shot the environmental scenery of her local area.</p> 
  	<p>Transitioning out of film and into digital photography was a slow but steady process that was completed when Kristi started attending the University of Miami in Fall of 2012. At the University she had a heighted desire to shoot photojournalistic material. Kristi began contributing to student media outlets including the Ibis yearbook, the Miami Hurricane and Distraction Magazine. She has taken thousands of photos around the University of Miami of specific on campus events. As the Historian of Chi Omega Fraternity she photographs all chapter events for social media outlets and Fraternity publications. Kristi will be working as Co-Photo Editor at the Ibis in Fall 2014.</p>
